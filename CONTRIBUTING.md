# Contributing

## Commit Message Format

The commit message format is as follows:

```
Tag: Short description

Longer description here if necessary
```

The `Tag` should be one of the following:

- `Fix` - for a bug fix.
- `Update` - for a backwards compatible enhancement.
- `Feature` - for a new feature.
- `Breaking` - for a backwards-incompatible enhancement or feature.
- `Perf` - for a code change that improves performance.
- `Refactor` - for a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature (nor is `Perf`).
- `Build` - for changes that affect the build system or external dependencies.
- `Test` - for adding or correcting tests.
- `Docs` - for changes to documentation only.
- `Other` - for anything that isn't covered by the tags above.

Those tags are an adapted version of the tags eslint (<https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/pull-requests#step-2-make-your-changes>) and of the tags Angular (<https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#type>) uses.
